# GeoClass--Uncertainty-classifier-How-to-visualise-uncertainty-by-zones-and-levels-
This model is a simple method to classify, quantify and illustrate the uncertainty in subsurface interpretation using python open source libraries. This model takes a practical and coding focused approach to visualise the uncertainty in subsurface interpretations by calculating zones and levels of uncertaintyâ€”the Five uncertainty zones created by measuring the distance from outcrops, galleries and boreholes.
